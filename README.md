# disservice

This is a C++ refresher for me after going on a long Go hiatus... not that long, but...
Think that C++ and golang combination would just be the most useful and efficient for building (malicious) backend and middleware systems.
Actually, besides being a C++ refresher, this is also a chance to learn the Boost library (<-- which was a pain in the a__ to install on Win).

This is a generic http server taken from the Boost examples and CMAKEd into working with CLion.
